Most existing approaches for network reconstruction can only infer an
overall network and, also, fail to capture a complete set of network
properties. To address these issues, a new model has been developed,
which converts static data into their ‘dynamic’ form. ‘idopNetwork’ can
inferring informative, dynamic, omnidirectional and personalized
networks.

## Installation

You can install the development version of idopNetwork from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("cxzdsa2332/idopNetwork")
```

## Vignette

We demonstrate how to use idopNetwork package to analysis gut microbiota
and mustard microbiota
data.(<https://cxzdsa2332.github.io/idopNetwork/articles/idopNetwork_vignette.html>)
